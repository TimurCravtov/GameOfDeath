# **Game of Death: A Magical Twist on Conway’s Game of Life**

> ⚠️ **Development in Progress**  
> This project is currently under active development for the **Multimedia Technologies** course.  
> Features like simulation logic, magical zones, and character behavior are being finalized. Stay tuned for the full release — coming soon on [itch.io](https://itch.io)! ✨

## **📌 Overview**

**Game of Death** is a creative reimagining of **Conway’s Game of Life**, developed in **Unity** using **C#**. Inspired by the world of **Harry Potter**, this simulation introduces magical elements, dynamic zones, and house-based logic to elevate the original cellular automaton.

The game is currently in active development as part of the **Multimedia Technologies** course assignment.

---

## **🧠 Theme & Concept**

In this magical simulation, each cell represents a member of one of the four Hogwarts houses. Based on their number and behavior:

- 🧙‍♂️ **Dumbledore** may appear when **Gryffindors** reach a certain concentration.
- 🐍 **Voldemort** may spawn from a rise in **Slytherins**.
- Special zones apply altered rules, affecting survival and evolution in unique ways.

---

## **🚧 Current Features (Work in Progress)**

- ✅ Grid-based layout with magical house cells
- ✅ Six unique prefabs for: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Dumbledore, and Voldemort
- ✅ Enum and data structure to manage cell types and neighbor logic
- ⏳ Dynamic zone system that alters evolution rules (Coming soon)
- ⏳ Simulation rule logic and evolution behavior (In progress)
- ⏳ Custom graphics, UI elements, and magical soundtrack

## **🚀 How to Run**

1. Open the project in **Unity**.
2. Open the main scene.
3. Press **Play** to preview the simulation grid.
4. (Coming Soon) Configure initial grid or play predefined patterns.
5. (Coming Soon) Watch magical patterns evolve and characters spawn!

## **📆 Status**

This project is **currently in development**. Final version will be uploaded to **itch.io** and presented as part of the **FAF 23x Laboratory 2**.

Stay tuned for updates and magical chaos! ✨
